        <p2> Valentine (6LACK) was born on June 24, 1992 in Baltimore, Maryland and moved to Atlanta, Georgia with his parents in 1997. Valentine is the oldest of 3 siblings. Valentine's first recording experience was when he was 4 years of age, at his father's studio. Valentine began rapping in middle school as a battle rapper and was involved in many battles in his youth including against rapper Young Thug.
6lack signed a record deal with Flo Rida's International Music Group and Strong Arm Records in July 2011. He left Valdosta State University once he signed, and spent the next few years learning about the industry. 6lack spent five years with the label, putting music out on his SoundCloud account. 6lack had little financial security and spent most of his time sleeping in the studio or outside on the street after moving to Miami to work on music with the record label. 6lack eventually left his label due to issues over artistic license and management. </p2> </aside>
